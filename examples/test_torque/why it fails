First check that kicks in is current:
Protection_Current (310) amperes or sth
Present_Current, compared against protection crrent
Over_Current_Protection_Time, how long until you shut it down

make a quick update about this 

variables of interest are 
Max_Torque_Limit = 1000, 
Present_Load = 1000-something, which triggered the overload torque mechanism
Overload_Torque = 80, how much of the max torque limit do we allow?
Protection_Time = 200, after how long do we set Torque_Enable to 1? *not true lol
Protective_Torque = 20, after we trigger the safety mechanism, how much torque do we allow the motor to have?

theres actually no temperature or voltage check that the feetechs perform, the only two are current and torque, which works like i said above
