# SO-101 Robot Arm - Final Solution

## Current Status

After extensive testing and troubleshooting, we have determined that:

1. **Working Arm (COM4)**:
   - ✅ Successfully communicates with all 6 motors
   - ✅ Responds correctly to all commands
   - ✅ Can be fully controlled with our custom script

2. **Non-Working Arm (COM3)**:
   - ✅ USB connection is detected
   - ❌ Still not responding to any motor commands
   - ❌ Power issue has not been resolved

3. **USB-C Connections**:
   - ❌ No USB-C devices are being detected as COM ports
   - ❌ May need drivers or different connection method

## Working Solution

The following script provides full control of the working arm on COM4:

```
python C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\working_arm_controller.py
```

This script allows you to:
- Select individual motors (1-6) using number keys
- Move motors with W (positive) and S (negative) 
- Return to rest position with R
- Toggle torque on/off with T
- Adjust step size with + and -
- Quit with Q

## Remaining Issues

1. **Leader Arm Power Problem**:
   - Despite checking the power, the arm on COM3 still doesn't respond
   - The controller board may be defective
   - The power connection might not be properly seated
   - The power supply might not be providing the correct voltage (7.4V)

2. **USB-C Connection Issue**:
   - The USB-C connections you mentioned aren't being detected by Windows
   - They may require specific drivers
   - They might be using a different protocol than CH343

## Next Steps

1. **For the Non-Working Arm (COM3)**:
   - Check if there are any LED indicators on the controller board
   - Verify that the voltage from the power supply is correct (7.4V)
   - Inspect all connections between controller and motors
   - Try a different power supply if available

2. **For the USB-C Connections**:
   - Check if they are properly connected
   - Look for unknown devices in Device Manager
   - Try installing drivers for USB-C to Serial adapters
   - Try different USB ports on your computer

3. **Continue With Working Arm**:
   - Use the working_arm_controller.py script to control the arm on COM4
   - Proceed with your project using the single working arm for now

## Technical Details

The system currently recognizes:
- COM3: USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH343 - no motor response
- COM4: USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH343 - all 6 motors respond correctly

No other COM ports or devices were found that could be the USB-C connections you mentioned.

## Created Solutions

We've developed several scripts to help you work with your robot:

1. `working_arm_controller.py` - Main interactive controller for the working arm
2. `check_leader_arm.py` - Script to test the leader arm for responses
3. `verify_usb_c.py` - Tool to check for USB-C device connections
4. `so101_windows_corrected.py` - Configuration file that correctly identifies the working arm

All scripts are located in the `C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs` directory.
