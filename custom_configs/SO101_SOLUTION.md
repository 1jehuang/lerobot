# SO-101 Robot Arm Solution

## Final Test Results

After extensive testing, we've determined that:

1. **COM4 (Working Arm)**:
   - ✅ Successfully communicates with all 6 motors
   - ✅ Responds correctly to ping commands 
   - ✅ Can be controlled using our custom script

2. **COM3 (Non-Working Arm)**:
   - ✅ USB connection works (can open port)
   - ❌ Does not respond to any motor commands
   - ❌ Likely has a power supply issue

## Working Solution

We've created a dedicated controller script for the working arm:

```bash
python C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\working_arm_controller.py
```

This script provides full interactive control of the working arm:
- Select motors 1-6 using number keys
- Move motors with W (positive) and S (negative)
- Return to rest position with R
- Toggle torque on/off with T
- Adjust step size with + and -
- Quit with Q

## Configuration

We've created a corrected configuration file that properly identifies the working arm:

```python
# Path: C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\so101_windows_corrected.py
```

This can be used with the main LeRobot scripts if needed.

## Non-Working Arm (COM3) - Troubleshooting

The primary issue with the non-working arm is likely a power supply problem:

1. **Power Connection**:
   - Verify that the power supply is properly connected
   - Check that the power supply is providing the correct voltage (7.4V)
   - Look for LED indicators on the control board

2. **Hardware Check**:
   - Inspect connections between controller and motors
   - Check for any visible damage to wires or components
   - Ensure motors are properly connected to controller board

3. **USB Connection**:
   - The USB connection to COM3 is working correctly
   - The issue is not with the USB or data connection
   - The controller board is likely not powered or defective

## USB-C Question

You mentioned the leader arm might be using USB-C. Our diagnostics show that:

1. Both connected arms use CH343 USB-Serial adapters (not USB-C devices)
2. The working arm is on COM4
3. The non-working arm is on COM3

If there's another arm with a USB-C connection, it's not currently recognized by the system. You would need to:
1. Check if the USB-C device is physically connected
2. Verify if drivers are installed for any USB-C devices
3. Look in Device Manager for unknown devices

## Technical Details

The issue was identified by:

1. Checking all USB and COM devices on the system
2. Testing communication on both COM3 and COM4
3. Verifying motor responses on each port
4. Fixing permission issues with the serial ports

The working arm (COM4) successfully responds to all 6 motor IDs with valid responses.

## Next Steps

1. **Use the working arm**: Continue your project with the working arm on COM4
2. **Verify power connections**: Check the power supply for the non-working arm
3. **Contact support**: If needed, reach out to LeRobot/Hugging Face support

## Additional Scripts

We've created several scripts to help diagnose and fix issues:

1. `working_arm_controller.py` - Main controller for the working arm
2. `so101_windows_corrected.py` - Corrected configuration file
3. `fix_port_access.bat` - Batch file to reset port permissions
4. `test_final.py` - Final test script showing which ports/motors work

All scripts are located in the `C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs` directory.
