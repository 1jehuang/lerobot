# SO-101 Robot Arm Solution Summary

## Current Status

After extensive testing, we have identified the following:

1. **Follower Arm (COM4)**: 
   - ✅ Successfully connecting to all 6 motors
   - ✅ All motors respond to ping commands
   - ✅ Can be controlled using the provided follower_arm_controller.py script

2. **Leader Arm (COM3)**:
   - ✅ USB connection works (can successfully open port)
   - ❌ No motors respond to any commands
   - ❌ Not responding at any baudrate or with any protocol version

## Most Likely Cause

The leader arm issue is most likely caused by one of the following:

1. **Power Supply Problem** (most likely):
   - The leader arm controller or motors aren't receiving power
   - The power supply might be disconnected, turned off, or defective
   - The leader arm requires a 7.4V power supply for STS3215 motors

2. **Controller Board Issue**:
   - The controller board might be defective
   - Internal connections might be damaged

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Verify Power Supply

- Check if the power supply is connected and turned on
- Look for any LED indicators on the controller board
- Verify that the power supply is providing the correct voltage (7.4V)
- Try a different power supply if available

### 2. Use the Follower Arm

You can continue working with the follower arm using the custom script:

```bash
python C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\follower_arm_controller.py
```

This script provides interactive control of the follower arm:
- Select motors 1-6 using the number keys
- Move motors using W (positive) and S (negative)
- Return to rest position with R
- Toggle torque on/off with T
- Adjust step size with + and -
- Quit with Q

### 3. Further Leader Arm Troubleshooting

If you want to continue troubleshooting the leader arm:

- Run the leader arm speed test to try different configurations:
  ```bash
  python C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\leader_speed_test.py
  ```

- Try the control board swap test to determine if it's a controller issue:
  ```bash
  python C:\Users\jerem\Downloads\lerobot\custom_configs\try_follower_motors_on_leader_port.py
  ```

### 4. Contact Support

If you're unable to resolve the leader arm issues:
- Contact LeRobot/Hugging Face support for technical assistance
- Consider ordering a replacement controller board if it's determined to be defective

## Conclusion

Your SO-101 robot can still be operated using just the follower arm. The provided follower_arm_controller.py script gives you full control over all 6 motors on the follower arm. The leader arm issue appears to be a hardware problem, most likely related to the power supply or controller board.
